# Multiple Linear Regression

Here we have a csv file containing many independent variables, and unlike simple linear regression, it is not possible to plot a basic 2D graph with x and y axis, as there are many parameters. 

It is beyond me to imagine something beyond a three dimensional graph. In this case there might exist a 6 dimensional graph, which I just mentioned is beyond me, so that's why we do not have a graph here.

So we use R^2 ( R square ) method to evaluate the validity of the graph, the concept is the closer the value  is to 1, the better the fit is.

Rest all is very similar to a simple linear regression.
